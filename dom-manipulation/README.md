# DOM Manipulation, Web Storage, and JSON Project
 
This project is all about building a **dynamic web application** using JavaScript. I learnt how to create content on the fly, save and load data using **web storage**, and work with **JSON data**.



## 🎯 What I Learnt

H

### 🧩 Work with the DOM
- Add and remove content on the page using JavaScript.
- Make your app respond to clicks, inputs, and other user actions.
- Use events to build an interactive experience.

### 💾 Use Web Storage
- Save information in the browser using **localStorage** and **sessionStorage**.
- Make an app remember things, even after a refresh.
- Learn the difference between temporary and long-term storage in the browser.

### 📦 Handle JSON Data
- Load and use data from a JSON file.
- Turn an app’s data into JSON so you can save it or send it to a server.
- Keep everything consistent when working with this format.

### 🔍 Filter and Sync Data
- Let users search or filter the content they see.
- (Bonus) Sync your local data with server data and handle changes without breaking things.

## 🧰 What We’ll Be Using

- **HTML** for structure  
- **CSS** for styling  
- **JavaScript** for logic  
- **Web Storage API** for saving data  
- **JSON** for handling and organizing data
